        I never believed in love. Never wanted it. I didn't see the practical
        value and, to be honest, I was doing just fine without it. But then I
        met you. You're smile, your strength, your intelligence and compassion.
        You filled a part of my soul I always thought would be empty, and you
        healed scars I never knew existed. And I realized... It's not that I
        didn't believe in love before. It's that I was saving it all for you.
